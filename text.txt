As a rising sophomore at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, I am excited to embark on my journey to gain more experience and knowledge in my field of interest. Although I am young, I am eager to learn and grow in any way possible. I am open to any internships or work experiences that will help me prepare for my future career.

In addition to gaining professional experience, I am also excited to be a part of any professional team. I consider myself to be an outgoing, hard-working, and cooperative individual, and I believe I can contribute positively to any team that I join.

Moreover, I have had plenty of experience being a leader, as demonstrated by my involvement in various extracurricular activities. I have developed skills in communication, problem-solving, and teamwork, and I am confident that I can continue to exercise my leadership skills in any setting.

I am actively seeking opportunities to develop myself professionally and personally, and I am excited to see where my journey takes me. If you are interested in connecting or collaborating, please feel free to reach out to me. Please take a look at my portfolio at https://hoangsonww.github.io/My-Portfolio-Website/
